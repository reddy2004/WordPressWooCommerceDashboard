# WordPressWooCommerceDashboard
A dashboard for managing orders and inventory for a wordpress e-commerce site which has woo commerce plugin installed. This program provides shipping tracking for Delhivery. 

I developed this Dashboard for managing a wordpress e-commerce site. www.snack-cart.in. We initially got the site developed on wordpress as the expected traffic would be quite less and wordpress is easy to get started with. Our delivery partner was www.delhivery.com.

However, working with wordpress was a pain for the following reasons.

(a) Wordpress backend is pathetic, slow, cluttered and difficult to update.

(b) Wordpress keeps messing up the inventory. Managing inventory via wordpress was a nightmare.

(c) Not mobile friendly.

(d) It does not have a dashboard to track the order until its delivered. Doing manually is cumbersome.
